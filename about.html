        <p>The owner opened up this restaurant to bring his grandmothers recipe to newcomers in America. Growing up his grandma's cooking was very popular in Thailand. When she passed away, he moved to Las Vegas and cooked this secret recipe for his friends once a week. They continued on asking him to cook it and it made him want to open this establishment. He now owns 4 locations on the west coast of United States.</p>
